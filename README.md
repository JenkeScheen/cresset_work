## backup of main data analysis notebooks generated during iCASE studentship placement

Generated in the period of Oct 2020 - Feb 2021

The two main notebooks of interest are analyse_MBAR.ipynb and analyse_lambda_allocations.ipynb; note that because of their size sometimes github isn't able to load the notebook. In this case refresh the page a few times until it works.
